# Goal

This project will walk you through the basics of a digital IC design flow using a PICORV RISC-V CPU core.  It will introduce you to both logic synthesis and place and route.  It will also help you understand the goals of optimizing Power/Performance/Area (PPA) for a digital circuit.  

# Setup

## Login to Burrow - RedHat

```bash
ssh burrow-rhel.luddy.indiana.edu -YCA
```

## Get the starter code

This only needs to be done once per project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/engr599-ic/P1_run_the_flow.git
cd P1_run_the_flow
make setup
```

# Running the flow

## Load CAD tools

This needs to be every time you log in.  It loads the Computer Aided Design (CAD) tools we'll be using.  They are also called "Electronic Design Automation (EDA)" tools.  

```bash
source load_tools.sh
```

If you get a "command not found" error, it's likely you forgot to (re)run this command. 

You can also add this to your `~/.bash_profile` if you want it to get run every time you log in.  

## Synthesis

This will run Synthesis, a process where an abstract description of a digital circuit (often at the register transfer level or RTL) is automatically translated into a gate-level implementation, optimized for specific design constraints

```bash
make synth
```

This will launch a tool named `genus`, and ask it to run the `synthesis.tcl` script.  It maps our RTL to Skywater Technology's S130 Process. This typically takes a few minutes. 

Once this is complete, it will generate a `postsynth.vg` file.  This is a Verilog Gate-Level netlist.  

You can also restore the synthesis database with:
```bash
genus -gui -db ./dbs/syn_opt.db
```


## Place and Route

Place and Route (P&R or PnR) is where electronic components and their interconnections are automatically arranged and routed on a chip or printed circuit board (PCB).  It is also called Automatic Place and Route (APR).  

```bash
make pnr
```

This launches a tool named `innovus`, and asks it to run `pnr.tcl`.  This will do the P&R on our previously synthesized netlist.  Once complete, you can open the database and view your results.  

```bash
innovus -stylus -db ./dbs/signoff.db
```

By default all database files are saved to the `dbs/` dir

## Timing

The file `functional.sdc` is a synopsis design constraint file that dictates how fast the clock will be in your design.
The synthesis and place and route tools will attempt to meet this timing constraint.
[SDC Command Reference](https://iccircle.com/static/upload/img20240131000211.pdf)

Timing reports can be found in the `RPT_final` directory as well as the `timingReports` directory.

### MMMC File

An MMMC file (multi-mode multi-corner) file creates all of the corner information used by the synthesis and pnr tools. 
This file sets the following:
  - Library Sets
    - Lists of `.lib` files that contain timing information for standard cells.
  - Constraint Modes
    - Links SDC files to specific Corners
  - Delay Corners
  - Analysis Views

# Getting Help

Both tools (genus and innovus) have a gui option that can be enabled by adding the `-gui` flag.  

For documentation on available commands, both tools (in GUI mode) also have a Help dropdown that includes the user guide.  

# Your Turn

Now that you know the basic flow, it's time to start tweaking for improved PPA (Power-Performance-Area).  Your task is customize this flow twice, once to optimize performance and once to optimize for area.  

## Part A:  Optimize for Performance

By default, your PICORV core is targetting a 100ns (10MHz) clock.  Your task is to see how high you can push the frequency without causing setup/hold violations on any of the process corners.  

## Suggested Steps

Start by modifying this line in the `functional.sdc` Constraint file: 
`create_clock -name clk -period 100 -waveform {0 50} [get_ports {clk}]`

You will likely need to optimize both the `synthesis.tcl` and `pnr.tcl` to achieve the highest performance. 

## Evaluating success

  We provide you with a `./check_timing.sh` command that will check the overall timing result to ensure there are no setup/hold violations.  Check the "Overall" result.  

## Part B:  Optimize for Area

Now it's time to optimize for minimal overal layout area.  Your task is to minimize the overall area without causing any DRC (Design Rule Check)/ connectivity errors.  These frequently occur when the router tries to squeeze too many routes (signal wires) into a given area because it is too compact.  

We suggest starting by modifying the `create_floorplan` command in `pnr.tcl`.  You will likely need to update `synthesis.tcl` also to achieve the best result.  

## Evaluating success

 We provide you with a `./check_drc.sh` command that will check your results are free from DRC  and connectivity errors.  Check the "Overall" result.
